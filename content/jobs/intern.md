If you are a undergrad student, doing a voluntary internship can be a good idea to get some first exposure with research, develop some useful skills and start growing your professional network. **This is not by any means a necessity or a requirement**, so don't worry *at all* if you cannot afford (financially or in availabilities) to volunteer, and check-out instead possibly [funded](https://realitybending.github.io/jobs/assistant/) positions.

**Contact.** Send CV to **D.Makowski@sussex.ac.uk** and *explicitly* say that you are interested in volunteering.

**Don't rely on what is written!**

Ask directly [members of team](/people/) (current and past) about their experience in the lab!
