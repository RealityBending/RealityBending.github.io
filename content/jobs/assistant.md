Working as a research assistant (RA) is a formidable opportunity to take on before - eventually - signing up for a PhD. It is a flexible and varied position, and a perfect position to develop key research skills like writing, data analysis or neuroimaging; and eventually later pursue a postgraduate program in psychology/neuroscience/neuropsychology.

## Sussex Psychology Placement Year

Students at the University of Sussex can also opt for a [placement year](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/psychology-with-a-professional-placement-year-bsc) between the second and third year of their studies. All undergraduates within the School are eligible to complete a placement year. 

While it might seem like it would "add" one year and *delay* the end of the studies, the experience that you could gain is quite invaluable. Doing a full-year placement year in a research lab is the best way to take on larger projects and acquire a comprehensive research experience. Beyond providing you with a massive headstart for the final year, it is a great opportunity to learn new skills and meet many researchers, which will help you refine your career trajectory and maximize your chances of **achieving your goals**.
