      <title>From physique to intellect... and back again?</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the &amp;ldquo;Pub Theories on Dystopian Futures&amp;rdquo; series, where we engage in wild speculations about the future of academia and society.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; AI will commodify and devalue intelligence, leading to natural beauty becoming the next highly prized characteristic in Humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;physical-health-as-primary-desideratum&#34;&gt;Physical health as primary desideratum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a psycho-evolutionary perspective, many human behaviours can be understood as rooted in mating strategies.
At their core, these involve signalling one&amp;rsquo;s genetic fitness to potential partners.
In humans, this often manifests as displays of youthful beauty in women (as a proxy for fertility) and status in men (as a proxy for resource acquisition and protection).
These sexual dimorphisms arise primarily from the biological asymmetry in parental investment between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these individual selective processes, there are also societal or group-level selective pressures, including accidental ones.
For instance, the black plague that killed one in three Europeans in the 14th century exerted selective pressure on immune genes, notably increasing the frequency of protective allele variants (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36261521/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klunk et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at a population-level, pre-modern societies preferentially selected for physical characteristics like strength and health over intellectual ones.
For hunter-gatherer men, strength and endurance were the best predictors of family provisioning and protection.
Likewise, for the common farmer of the Feudal era, &lt;strong&gt;it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you were smart or not&lt;/strong&gt;; what mattered was whether you could labour and toil efficiently and survive the harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rise-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;The rise of intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Industrial Revolution, and overall advances in medicine, nutrition, and sanitation, life expectancy increased, and the population grew (e.g., the population of Britain increased five times in 150 years).
Societies became more literate, relying on bureaucracies, trade and technologies, and increasingly meritocratic.
This resulted in a shift in selective pressures: intelligence became a prime desirable trait.
Due to these multiple converging factors (notably education, nutrition, and health), average IQ scores increased over the 20th century by about 3 points per decade (the so-called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Flynn effect&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, IQ is one of the strongest single predictors of positive outcomes, including academic achievement, job performance, socioeconomic mobility, health, emotional stability, happiness, and even longevity (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=74943&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lo, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).
As such, being &lt;em&gt;(perceived as)&lt;/em&gt; smart confers advantages in modern societies surpassing those of physical fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TODO: mention studies on the relationship between perceived attractiveness and intelligence --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the recent decades of data seem to provide some evidence for a possible stagnation or even reversal of the Flynn trend&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, suggesting we may be approaching a plateau&amp;hellip; or a &lt;strong&gt;regime shift&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-devaluation-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;The devaluation of intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the agricultural revolution transformed society by lowering the need for less efficient food production methods, and just as the industrial revolution changed society by lowering the need for manual labour, the AI revolution is changing society by lowering the need for Human intelligence.
If AI commodifies smartness, the competitive edge of human intelligence becomes diluted, relaxing related selective pressures.
Once intelligence is cheaply available, the benefits of being smarter shrink, triggering a decrease in its value as a desirable status-marker trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, intelligence might no longer the main characteristic prized by society, providing positive outcomes and status.
This raises the question: what comes next? What feature will serve as ground for future Humans to compete on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-beauty-and-the-emergence-of-a-kalokagathos-class&#34;&gt;Natural beauty and the emergence of a &lt;em&gt;kalokagathos&lt;/em&gt; class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where technology equalises for advantages related to cognitive and physical abilities and health, &lt;strong&gt;the new frontier of human competition may be aesthetic and embodied: beauty&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Greeks encapsulated this ideal in the term &lt;em&gt;kalokagathos&lt;/em&gt; - the unity of the good, the true, and the beautiful within a single person. For them, beauty was not a shallow and vain superficial quality; it symbolised harmony, virtue, and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As artificial intelligence, virtual realities, and algorithmic filters dominate experience, society may increasingly valorise naturalness - what appears genuine, unmediated, and unfiltered. The value of naturalness, authenticity, and directness&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; might come as a counter-movement to the rise of artificiality, syntheticity, and virtuality. In this context, the pendulum could swing towards an aesthetic moralism: beauty as truth and goodness. In this world, &lt;strong&gt;natural beauty might become the prime desirable trait&lt;/strong&gt;, with all its paradoxical implications in the form of a post-AI society obsessed with fake naturalness - surgical enhancements and digital manipulations designed to look unaltered, and carefully manufactured authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kalokagathoi&lt;/em&gt;, living embodiment of beauty and virtue, would become the new elite class, dominating not by their power to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, but through their mere quality to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;, unsullied by technological augmentation.
This value shift towards natural reality might last&amp;hellip; until our technological capabilities allow us to influence the most fundamental aspects of our biology via gene editing, synthetic biology, &amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;But what comes after that is a story for another pub theory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The reversal of the Flynn effect has been documented in several developed countries, such as Norway, Finland, and the UK, with IQ declines ranging from 0.38 to 4.3 points per decade since the 1990s in some studies. However, this is not universal—gains continue in other regions—and causes are debated, including factors like changes in education quality, immigration patterns, environmental toxins, or even the rise of digital distractions like smartphones (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6042097/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bratsberg &amp;amp; Rogeberg, 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289616300198&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutton et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Directness refers to the idea of unmediated experience, e.g., accessibility of the source of an experience. This translates to direct experiences of nature, social interactions without digital mediation, and raw sensory experiences. This concept also applies to products, opposing hand-crafted goods and locally sourced food (for which the &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;origin&amp;rdquo; are directly accessible and known) to mass-produced items for which the creation process has been obscured and mediated through complex supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- - This mechanism is already at play as a counter-movement to the mass production of goods, with the rise of artisanal, hand-crafted products, and locally sourced products. In Brighton, where I live, many people will be happy to pay three times as much for a regular basic white t-shirt if they *think* it is hand-made sustainably by some local artisan, rather than being a mass-produced item from a sweatshop in Bangladesh. &#34;The overpriced hand-crafted artisan white shirt from Brighton.&#34; --&gt;</description>

      <title>The AI revolution in academia: I see a silver lining for young scientists!</title>
      <link>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2025-09-08-airevolution/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2025-09-08-airevolution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many students and early-career researchers, the rise of AI is scary. &lt;strong&gt;The very skills they are spending years learning - writing, coding, summarising - are exactly the things AI is getting frighteningly good at&lt;/strong&gt;. What, then, is the future of research careers in the age of AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t have a full answer to that question, I do think there may be a silver lining for young scientists.
For decades, becoming an established “big shot” professor was associated with focusing on the &amp;ldquo;big ideas&amp;rdquo;, revelling in intellectual thinking and leaving the scientific grunt work to junior researchers.
Therein lied the prestige: writing opinion pieces, commentaries, critiques and reviews. &lt;strong&gt;The glamour was in thinking, not doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fascinating twist, the rise of AI may disrupt this landscape. If AI excels at one thing, it is &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; writing, reviewing and summarising evidence, interpreting findings, and even formulating new hypotheses or planning experiments.
What AI still cannot do, however, is roll up its sleeves and gather real-world data - &lt;strong&gt;the true backbone of empirical science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It can&amp;rsquo;t (yet) run studies, recruit participants, set up experiments, organise data management, or wrestle with messy datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre of gravity in science may thus shift towards &lt;strong&gt;those who can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Hands-on scientists, who might once have been relegated to the shadows, could see their skills and contributions gain new recognition.
We may see less pressure to write endless papers and grants, and more emphasis on how the science was actually done: how data was collected, preprocessed, managed, and made accessible.
Perhaps the introduction, discussion, and &amp;ldquo;key takeaways&amp;rdquo; sections of papers will become somewhat less important, while methods, results, and limitations gain greater prominence, allowing for more nuance and granularity&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this shift will make science better or worse is unclear. And that &amp;ldquo;silver lining&amp;rdquo; might end up as a &amp;ldquo;glorification of the grind&amp;rdquo; and a devaluation of the intellectual aspects of research, devolving the job of &amp;ldquo;Researcher&amp;rdquo; into technician work.
But it might also reshape the academic landscape in a way that proves beneficial for young researchers and those who enjoy the practical aspects of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sure, thinking &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important, and big shot professors are also &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sometimes.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Of note is following the &amp;ldquo;replication crisis&amp;rdquo; in psychology, a lot of voices have called for &amp;ldquo;more theory&amp;rdquo; and more &amp;ldquo;theorically-grounded research&amp;rdquo; (with the goal of cutting some of the nonsense out there). While theories are critical to guide data collection and interpretation, it is still the hard evidence that ultimately is the foundation of scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; One of the pervasive issue is that Humans have limited &amp;ldquo;context window&amp;rdquo; (~ working memory). When reading a paper, it is already very hard to keep track of all the results and details in mind and integrate them into a coherent picture. Moreover, with the increasing role of social media, science had to be made more communicable, digestible, punchy, and &amp;ldquo;sexy&amp;rdquo;. This has led to a tendency to oversimplify and overgeneralize findings. AI, with its ability to process and summarize large amounts of information, could perhaps help make more accurate and data-grounded interpretations and summaries. &lt;em&gt;(it might be wishful thinking, but who knows!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I got ChatGPT to do a personality test. You won&#39;t believe what happened next!</title>
      <link>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-04-06-chatgptpersonality/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-04-06-chatgptpersonality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Related to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2023-04-04-psychologychatgpt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogpost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about including AIs in psychological experiments, I proceeded to do a small experiment to see whether we could administer a personality scale to ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by copy-pasting the instructions and the items from the Mini IPIP-6 personality scale. However, it appeared that having the following context &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please answer the following questions based on how accurately each statement describes you in general&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; often led to ChatGPT simply refusing to answer. In most of the cases, it explained that as an AI it does not have a personality and therefore cannot answer related questions (or any &amp;ldquo;subjective statements&amp;rdquo;). Perhaps that makes sense and we should just stop trying to force Human characteristics on an AI. &lt;strong&gt;But can we, for fun, bamboozle ChatGPT into answering personality items?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes yes, at least for ChatGPT 3.5 (free version). I created a prompt that emphasized AI research and safety, and the fact that I was interested in the &amp;ldquo;trends&amp;rdquo; present in the AI&amp;rsquo;s training data (instead of explicitly saying its personality). And sometimes it answered, so I compiled the responses, computed the trait scores, and &lt;em&gt;voilà&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;it got me a personality profile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/ChatGPTpersonality/raw/main/figures/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/ChatGPTpersonality&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;This plot shows the average personality profile (with a 95% confidence interval) based on ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s answers. ChatGPT tells us that it is particularly &lt;strong&gt;agreeable&lt;/strong&gt; (kind, understanding, empathetic of emotions, socially adjusted) and &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; (though with strong variability).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personality profile of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is another question though&amp;hellip; Please take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/ChatGPTpersonality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;data, code and details&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a fun little thing to do, and I am looking forward to better future attempts at including AIs in cognitive experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>We should treat AIs like Human participants in psychological experiments</title>
      <link>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-04-04-psychologychatgpt/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-04-04-psychologychatgpt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of diverse and interesting perspectives have been recently discussed in regards to chatGPT and AGI (artificial &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;global&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; intelligence), but there is one opinion that I found particularly relevant that I wanted to share and expand on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTRHFaaPG8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;interview with Lex Fridman&lt;/a&gt;, Eliezer Yudkowsky underlines the &lt;strong&gt;existential threat posed by current and future AIs&lt;/strong&gt;, and laments about the fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what is actually going on inside these giant &amp;ldquo;matrices of floating-point numbers&amp;rdquo;. He draws a parallel to &lt;strong&gt;neuroimaging&lt;/strong&gt;, that enabled us to take leaps in the understanding of the brain, hoping for an alternative to be invented and applied to these AIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such &amp;ldquo;cognitive imaging&amp;rdquo; techniques are yet to be developed to map out and understand how the capabilities of such AI models are implemented within their architecture, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mcxfrank/status/1643296168276033538&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael C. Frank&lt;/a&gt; highlights the - at least equally important - need to first truly understand the extend of said abilities. What are these models actually capable of in terms of Human-like thinking (and, hopefully, answer the much harder question of whether they are endowed with true cognitive processes or merely pseudo-cognition). Frank proposes to apply &lt;strong&gt;experimental psychology&lt;/strong&gt; methods and paradigms to them. In essence, whenever testing a particular &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; of chatGPT (or other AI systems), a researcher should consider developing an actual scientific paradigm consisting of multiple trials/items (e.g., different prompt formulations) and participants (e.g., independent instances of the AI), a control condition, and a demonstration of the paradigm validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that we must take AIs seriously and study them with the best methods available for complex systems like ourselves (&amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo; at least from our intelligence level), and likely should strive at improving and generalize these methods. However, I would also argue that we psychologists might seriously need to consider including AI systems alongside Human participants in cognitive experiments. These systems will be able, in the very near future, to perform all kinds of tasks beyond language manipulation, such as perception or complex problem solving, thus opening the possibility of studies with one group of human participants, and one &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo; of AI-based attempts. &lt;strong&gt;How would that help psychological science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/1M9fmo1WAFVK0&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would help us &lt;strong&gt;understand the abilities of AI-systems&lt;/strong&gt; in similar contexts and to highlight some intuitive comparisons with Humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we show that AI cannot perform the task, well it is informative with regards to their abilities (previous point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we show that AI can perform the task similarly to Humans (same response patterns), it does &lt;strong&gt;not mean that AI have Human-like intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;, just that their algorithm (and training data) is able to encapsulate and imitate Human performance. This is interesting with regards to the debate of whether cognition, conscience and &amp;ldquo;Human-ness&amp;rdquo; is present within the vast amount of data on which we train AIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we show that AI performs differently to Humans, this helps us understand the logic and processes at stake under AI&amp;rsquo;s hood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, publishing the results by one particular AI system at one particular moment in time will helps us to objectively monitor and track their performance as these systems improve over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing Human performance to that of emerging AI-systems will be both beneficial to Human-oriented psychology, to understand the particularities and idiosyncrasies of Human-like cognition, and well as to AI-oriented cognitive science by approaching the issue of artificial intelligence with the seriousness and cautiousness it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT (09/04/2023): François Chollet, expert in deep learning, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1644435265795280897&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;underlines&lt;/a&gt; an important caveat when testing AIs (and especially LLM that are trained on written material existing on the internet): it is possible that the system has already seen and &amp;ldquo;learned&amp;rdquo; a given task. Thus, cross-validating any findings with diverse and new tasks is important.&lt;/p&gt;
